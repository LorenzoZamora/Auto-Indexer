[CSCI 1300 - Introduction to OOP] Programming Assignment 7: Program that takes an editor's notes on an index for a book, 
and organizes them into a clean and organized index by topics and their page numbers.

Hello there!

This is the seventh and final programming assignment that I had to do for my Introduction to Object Oriented Programming class
during the Spring 2018 semester at Saint Louis University.

We were given a problem where an editor for a programming textbook had written notes for its index, where one line is the page number,
and the following lines are the topics that can be found on that page. It repeats accordingly for the different page numbers and their
corresponding topics.

Thus, this Auto Indexer takes the editor's notes, and irrespective of whether the topics were capitalized or not, organizes the topics
one per line alphabetically, with their page numbers following the topics.
