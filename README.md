## Auto-Indexer [CSCI1300 â€” Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming]

Hello there! 

This is the seventh and final programming assignment that I had to do for my 
Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming class, during the Spring 2018 
semester at Saint Louis University.

We were given a problem where an editor for a programming textbook had written 
notes for the book's index, where one line is the page number, and the following 
lines are the topics that can be found on that page. It repeats accordingly for 
the different page numbers and their corresponding topics.

Thus, I had created an Auto-Indexer that takes the editor's notes in the 
aforementioned format, and irrespective of whether the topics were capitalized or 
not, organizes the topics alphabetically, with one topic per line, and the 
associated page numbers following after the topic.
